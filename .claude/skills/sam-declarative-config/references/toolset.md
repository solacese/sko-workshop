# Kind: `toolset`

Manifest path: `resources.toolsets`

A toolset is a discoverable collection of tools (Python or Go binaries)
that agents can call. The metadata (name, description, shared config)
lives in YAML; the actual tool code lives in a per-toolset directory
under the same `toolsets/` tree. Built-in toolsets do not need a YAML
entry — list them under `toolsets:` on the agent that uses them.

## On-disk layout

Everything for a toolset lives under `toolsets/`:

```
toolsets/
  <name>.yaml             kind: toolset metadata + spec.config
  <name>/
    src/                  build sources (author flow — Go go.mod, Python
                          requirements.txt, or build.sh/build.bat —
                          see tool-build.md)
    <name>.zip            pre-built bundle (mirror flow — see below)
    dist/<os>-<arch>/     per-target build output (gitignored)
    .sam-cache/build/
      <os>-<arch>/        per-target build cache (gitignored)
```

Each toolset is in exactly one of two workflows, which the resolver
picks up purely from filesystem state:

- **Author flow** — `toolsets/<name>/src/` exists. `sam config plan` /
  `apply` runs the build pipeline, zips `dist/`, and uploads.
- **Mirror flow** — `toolsets/<name>/<name>.zip` exists. The pre-built
  zip is uploaded as-is. This is the canonical output of
  `sam config pull`: pull from SAM-A, apply to SAM-B without rebuilding.

Both `src/` and `<name>.zip` present at the same toolset is a hard
error — the two workflows are mutually exclusive. Delete whichever path
doesn't match your current intent.

## CLI lifecycle

The full set of commands that touch a toolset, in roughly the order an
author hits them:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sam toolset init NAME [PATH] --lang go\|python` | Scaffolds `toolsets/<name>.yaml` + `toolsets/<name>/src/` with a working samtoolsdk skeleton and `build.sh`/`build.bat`. Go tools get the SDK source vendored from the CLI binary into `_sdk/samtoolsdk/` (no network needed). Python tools declare `sam-tool-sdk>=0.1,<0.2` from PyPI in `pyproject.toml` (network needed at `pip install` time). |
| `sam toolset sync [PATH] [--name N] [--lang …]` | Re-vendors the embedded Go SDK in one or every `toolsets/*/src/`. Run after a CLI upgrade. No-op for Python tools (which pull from PyPI). |
| `sam config plan` | Shows the diff. Builds (or cache-hits) author-flow toolsets and shows `[BUILD: built/cache-hit <os>/<arch>]` (target tuple included so a stale-platform cache hit is visible); mirror-flow toolsets show `[BUILD: none]`. |
| `sam config apply` | Builds, zips, uploads. Waits for platform `discoveryStatus = ready` before PATCHing `spec.config` so the toolset has its declared schema by the time config lands. |
| `sam config pull` | Mirror flow. Writes `toolsets/<name>.yaml` (with secrets rewritten as `${TOOLSET_<NAME>_<KEY>}`) and `toolsets/<name>/<name>.zip` (verbatim bundle bytes). The output is a `sam config apply`-ready repo. |
| `sam config cache prune` | Walks every `toolsets/*/.sam-cache/` and applies the prune policy (default: 30-day age cap). Cache never auto-prunes. |
| `--no-build` | Skips builds (soft-skip on plan, hard-error on apply). For CI flows that build in a separate step. |

See `references/tool-build.md` for the deep dive on the build pipeline
(resolution order, script contract, `dist/` convention, cross-platform).

## Scaffolding a new tool

`sam toolset init NAME [PATH] --lang go|python` scaffolds a working
tool directory under `toolsets/<name>/src/`.

- **Go tools**: the Go SDK source is embedded in the CLI binary and
  written to `toolsets/<name>/src/_sdk/samtoolsdk/` at scaffold time. The
  generated `go.mod` references it via a `replace` directive so the tree
  builds offline. `sam toolset sync` re-vendors after a CLI upgrade.
- **Python tools**: the scaffold's `pyproject.toml` depends on
  `sam-tool-sdk>=0.1,<0.2` from PyPI. Local dev uses `pip install -e .`
  into a venv for IDE autocomplete; the build (see below) re-installs
  into the deployment-target Lambda Layer via `pip install --target`.

See `references/tool-build.md` § "Scaffolding a new tool" for
path-resolution rules and language-specific examples.

## Build behavior (author flow)

`sam config plan` and `sam config apply` build tool sources before
bundling them — Go and Python sources compile via convention, anything
else can ship a `build.sh` / `build.bat` pair. Built bundles are cached
per-toolset AND per-target under
`toolsets/<name>/.sam-cache/build/<os>-<arch>/` keyed by source content
hash + target tuple, so warm-cache plans are no-ops and a local
`darwin/arm64` build can't poison a `linux/arm64` deploy. `--no-build`
skips builds (soft-skip on plan, hard-error on apply).

`sam config cache prune` walks every `toolsets/*/.sam-cache/` under the
repo root and applies the prune policy uniformly.

If a Go tool's vendored SDK directory (`_sdk/`) is missing at build
time — e.g. you cloned a repo where `_sdk/` is gitignored — the build
pipeline re-injects the embedded SDK from the CLI binary before running
`build.sh`. A one-line info log surfaces the action. Set
`SAM_TOOL_SDK_REFRESH=1` to force a re-vendor on every build. Python
tools have no equivalent self-heal — `pip install` from PyPI handles
dependency resolution on each build.

See `references/tool-build.md` for the full resolution order, build
script contract, cache layout, and CLI flags. The skill's
`sam config cache prune` subcommand is documented there too.

## Toolset-level config

A toolset's `spec.config:` block declares **shared default values** for
the toolset's declared config fields (the same fields each tool's
`samtoolsdk.ConfigSchemaField` describes). On `sam config apply`, those
values are PATCHed to `/api/v1/platform/toolsets/{id}/config` and
become the default that every agent using the toolset inherits.

```yaml
kind: toolset
name: openai-tools
description: "OpenAI tool package."
spec:
  config:
    api_base: ${OPENAI_API_BASE, https://api.openai.com/v1}
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}    # secret; resolved from the local env
```

Authoring rules:

- **Put secrets at the toolset level**, not per-agent. One API key
  serves every agent using the toolset; the per-agent
  `toolsetConfigs:` block is for non-secret tunables (model name,
  temperature, …) that diverge across agents.
- `${VAR}` and `${VAR, default}` references are substituted from the
  process environment at apply time (the same `configloader.ExpandVars`
  pass the rest of the YAML uses). Set the env var before running
  `sam config apply` — secrets never round-trip through git.
- Secret fields the platform returns redacted as `<REDACTED>` on
  subsequent GETs are dynamically excluded from the plan-time diff, so
  re-plans of an unchanged repo emit no spurious UPDATE for the
  toolset.

### Reserved key: `auth` (deployer OAuth credentials)

For tools that declare `samtoolsdk.WithAuth` (or its Python equivalent), the
SDK contributes the OAuth *protocol shape* — `type`, scope list, authorization
URL, token URL — but **not** the per-deployment OAuth client identity. That
half lives in `spec.config.auth`, a reserved key inside the same config map:

```yaml
kind: toolset
name: atlassian_rest_request
spec:
  config:
    base_url: https://api.atlassian.com
    auth:
      credential:
        client_id: ${ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}
      scheme:
        audience: api.atlassian.com               # optional
        refresh_url: https://auth.example/refresh # optional
        token_endpoint_auth_method: none          # optional
```

Validator rules (enforced on `sam config apply`):

- `auth.credential` accepts **only** `client_id`. Secrets (`client_secret`,
  `token`, `password`, …) are rejected — they must flow through the
  per-user credential store at runtime, never through declarative config.
- `auth.scheme` accepts **only** `audience`, `refresh_url`, and
  `token_endpoint_auth_method`. The SDK-declared `authorization_url`,
  `token_url`, and `scopes` are authoritative — overriding them is rejected
  with HTTP 400 to prevent silent drift.
- `auth.type` is rejected — the SDK declaration sets it.
- Tools cannot declare a `ConfigSchemaField` whose `key` is `auth`; the SDK
  panics at registration and the platform rejects the upload as a fallback.

At deploy time the platform merges this block on top of the SDK-declared
auth and emits it as the per-tool `auth:` block in the runtime YAML AWE
consumes.

## Per-agent overlay (`toolsetConfigs`)

A toolset's `spec.config` is the **shared default** — every agent that
uses the toolset inherits those values. To override values for a
specific agent (e.g. point that agent at a different region, raise its
timeout, swap models), declare a `toolsetConfigs[*]` entry on the
agent's YAML:

```yaml
# agents/sales-bot.yaml
kind: agent
name: sales-bot
spec:
  toolsets:
    - openai-tools          # references toolsets/openai-tools.yaml
  toolsetConfigs:
    - toolsetName: openai-tools
      configValues:
        api_base: https://api.openai.example.internal/v1   # agent-specific override
        verbose: true                                      # not set at toolset level
```

At deploy time the runtime merges the two sources per key:
**`toolsetConfigs[*].configValues` wins where keys collide**, otherwise
the toolset-level `spec.config` value falls through. Keys that appear
only in `spec.config` are inherited unchanged; keys that appear only in
the agent overlay are added on top.

The shape of `configValues` depends on the toolset's nature:

| Toolset nature | `configValues` shape | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `kind: toolset` package (this kind) | **Flat** map of `field → value`, e.g. `{api_key: …, timeout: 30}`. | Schema-validated against the toolset's `config_schema` (the same fields each tool's `samtoolsdk.ConfigSchemaField` describes). |
| Builtin toolset (e.g. `builtin_research_tools`) | **Nested by tool name**, e.g. `{deep_research: {max_iterations: 2, sources: [web]}}`. Top-level keys must be tools the toolset registers. | The AWE runtime validates the inner per-tool config shape at parse time. |

Authoring guidance:

- **Put secrets at the toolset level** (`spec.config`), not in the
  agent overlay. The overlay is for non-secret per-agent tunables.
- The overlay is the right place for fields that diverge across
  agents that share the toolset — region, model name, temperature,
  verbosity.
- Round-trip on pull: the agent's `toolsetConfigs[*].configValues`
  comes back as literal values. Secret fields inside the overlay are
  rewritten as `${TOOLSET_<NAME>_<KEY>}` placeholders just like
  `spec.config`.
- The reserved `auth` key works in the overlay too — agents that need
  a different OAuth client identity than the toolset default supply
  their own `auth.credential.client_id` here. Merge semantics match
  every other key: agent overlay wins where keys collide, so the
  agent's full `auth` block replaces the toolset's. To tweak one field
  copy the toolset block and edit.

## Mirror flow (pull → apply)

`sam config pull` downloads:

- `toolsets/<name>.yaml` — metadata + `spec.config` with secrets
  rewritten as `${TOOLSET_<NAME>_<KEY>}` placeholders.
- `toolsets/<name>/<name>.zip` — the platform's stored bundle bytes,
  verbatim.

A subsequent `sam config apply` against a different SAM instance picks
up the zip, skips the build pipeline, and uploads the bundle as-is.
Secrets are not pulled — the placeholders must be filled by env vars or
`~/.sam/secrets/<toolset>.env` before apply succeeds.

**Pulled non-secret values are literal** — `${VAR}` references are not
preserved across the round-trip; only secret fields come back as
placeholders. If you want to re-template after a pull, re-add the
`${VAR}` reference by hand. The same caveat already applies to connector
`authConfig` and model `apiKey` fields.


## Schema

CreateToolsetRequest is the request body for POST /toolsets.

| Field | Type | Required | Validation | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | yes |  | (no description) |
| `description` | `string` |  |  | (no description) |

## Example

```yaml
kind: toolset
name: example_toolset
# optional: description: "Example toolset description (replace me)."
```
