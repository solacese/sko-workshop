# Kind: `experiment`

Manifest path: `resources.experiments`

An experiment binds a dataset to a target agent and a list of
evaluators, parameterising the evaluation run. Trigger an experiment
from the CLI with `sam eval run <experiment-name>` (it polls the run
to completion and prints a results summary).

Cross-resource references — `datasetId`, `evaluatorIds`,
`primaryEvaluatorId` — accept *names*, not platform UUIDs. The
reconciler resolves names to IDs at apply time using the platform's
list of datasets and evaluators; a dangling reference hard-errors at
plan time with a clear message naming the missing resource.

Experiments depend on their referenced datasets and evaluators, so
list them in the manifest's `resources:` block under
`datasets:` and `evaluators:` (or import the relevant sources). The
reconciler applies datasets and evaluators before experiments so a
fresh apply lands cleanly.
