# Tool build reference

`sam config plan` and `sam config apply` build tool sources before
bundling them for upload. The build resolver picks a strategy from the
contents of `toolsets/<name>/src/`, runs it (when needed), and caches
the resulting zip at
`toolsets/<name>/.sam-cache/build/<targetOS>-<targetArch>/<hash>.zip`
so subsequent plans against the same source AND target are no-ops. The
target tuple is also mixed into the hash, so a cache zip dropped into
the wrong subdir fails the integrity check rather than silently
serving a binary for the wrong platform. Each toolset has its own
cache — removing the toolset directory cleans up its cache.

This describes the **author flow only**. If `toolsets/<name>/<name>.zip`
exists (mirror flow, e.g. after `sam config pull`), the resolver
uploads the bundle as-is and the build pipeline is skipped entirely.

This file is the authoring contract for the build pipeline. Read it when
you add a new toolset, change one's build, or hit `[BUILD: …]` output
you don't recognise.

## Scaffolding a new tool

The SAM tool SDK ships **embedded in the `sam` CLI binary** for both
Go and Python:

- **Go SDK** — the full `pkg/samtoolsdk/` source tree is baked into
  the CLI. `sam toolset init --lang go` writes it to
  `toolsets/<name>/src/_sdk/samtoolsdk/` and points the generated
  `go.mod` at it via a `replace` directive. No network access is
  required at scaffold time or build time.
- **Python SDK** — `sam-tool-sdk` is a normal PyPI package. The
  scaffolded `pyproject.toml` pins it narrowly
  (`sam-tool-sdk>=0.1,<0.2`) so a breaking 0.x release does not silently
  break existing tools. Local dev uses `pip install -e .` into a venv
  for IDE autocomplete and unit tests; the build uses
  `pip install --target dist/<os>-<arch>/python .` to drop the SDK,
  every transitive dep, and the tool's own source into the deployment
  Lambda Layer. Both steps need network access to reach PyPI.

The same embedded blob is **also used at build time**: if a tool's
SDK directory is missing when `sam config apply` runs (e.g. you cloned
a repo where `_sdk/` is `.gitignore`d), the build pipeline re-injects
the SDK from the CLI binary before invoking `build.sh`. A single-line
info log surfaces the action:

```
sam: vendored samtoolsdk into <name>/_sdk/ (was missing)
```

If the SDK is already present, the injector stays silent. Set
`SAM_TOOL_SDK_REFRESH=1` in your environment to force a re-vendor on
every build — useful after a CLI upgrade when you'd rather not commit
a new `_sdk/`. Without that opt-in, an existing `_sdk/` is left alone.

### `sam toolset init`

```
sam toolset init NAME [PATH] --lang go|python [--force]
```

- **NAME** — toolset directory name (e.g. `pptx`). Validated as a safe
  path component: no `/`, no leading dot.
- **PATH** *(optional)* — flexible target. Three forms; first match wins:
  1. Full path ending in `toolsets/<name>` → used verbatim; `src/` is
     created inside.
  2. A `toolsets/` directory → toolset is created as
     `<path>/<name>/src/`.
  3. Anything else → treated as the repo root; toolset is created as
     `<path>/toolsets/<name>/src/`.
  Defaults to the current working directory.
- **`--lang go|python`** — required. No default; the user must choose.
- **`--force`** — overwrite an existing non-empty target.

### Init examples

Go tool, scaffolded from the repo root:

```
$ sam toolset init pptx --lang go
scaffolded go tool at /repo/toolsets/pptx/src
  injected SDK vendor copy from CLI binary

Next steps:
  cd /repo/toolsets/pptx/src
  ./build.sh
```

Layout written:

```
toolsets/pptx.yaml         # kind: toolset, name: pptx
toolsets/pptx/
  src/
    main.go                # samtoolsdk-driven greet() skeleton
    go.mod                 # replace samtoolsdk => ./_sdk/samtoolsdk
    _sdk/samtoolsdk/       # embedded SDK source (gitignored by default)
    build.sh / .bat        # cross-platform build scripts
    manifest.yaml          # STR registration (kind/runtime/executable)
    README.md
```

Python tool, scaffolded against a `toolsets/` directory:

```
$ sam toolset init weather ./my-repo/toolsets --lang python
scaffolded python tool at /my-repo/toolsets/weather/src
```

Layout written:

```
toolsets/weather.yaml
toolsets/weather/
  src/
    pyproject.toml          # depends on sam-tool-sdk>=0.1,<0.2 from PyPI;
                            # declares [project.scripts] weather = "weather:cli"
    src/weather/
      __init__.py           # re-exports cli (the tool_cli callable)
      __main__.py           # tool function + cli = tool_cli(greet)
    build.sh                # pip install --target dist/<os>-<arch>/python .
    build.bat               # Windows equivalent of build.sh
    manifest.yaml           # runtime: python, executable: python/bin/weather
    README.md
```

Specific path with overwrite:

```
sam toolset init pptx ./my-repo/toolsets/pptx --lang go --force
```

### How the scaffolded toolset builds

The scaffold writes **both** `build.sh`/`build.bat` *and* the
language-convention markers (`go.mod` for Go, `pyproject.toml` for
Python). Because the resolver tries the host-appropriate build script
first, every freshly-scaffolded toolset takes the **script path**, not
the convention path. The scripts themselves shell out to the language
toolchain — they're thin wrappers, not custom builds.

Generated Go `build.sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

OUT_DIR="${SAM_TOOL_BUILD_OUT:-dist}"
NAME="${SAM_TOOL_NAME:-<name>}"

mkdir -p "$OUT_DIR"
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o "$OUT_DIR/$NAME" .
cp manifest.yaml "$OUT_DIR/manifest.yaml"
```

Generated Python `build.sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

OUT_DIR="${SAM_TOOL_BUILD_OUT:-dist}"
TARGET_OS="${SAM_TOOL_TARGET_OS:-linux}"
TARGET_ARCH="${SAM_TOOL_TARGET_ARCH:-arm64}"
PYTHON_VERSION="${SAM_TOOL_PYTHON_VERSION:-3.13}"

case "$TARGET_OS-$TARGET_ARCH" in
  linux-arm64)   PLATFORM=manylinux2014_aarch64 ;;
  linux-amd64)   PLATFORM=manylinux2014_x86_64 ;;
  darwin-arm64)  PLATFORM=macosx_11_0_arm64 ;;
  darwin-amd64)  PLATFORM=macosx_10_9_x86_64 ;;
esac

mkdir -p "$OUT_DIR/python"
python3 -m pip install --target "$OUT_DIR/python" \
  --platform "$PLATFORM" \
  --python-version "$PYTHON_VERSION" \
  --only-binary=:all: \
  --upgrade \
  .

cp manifest.yaml "$OUT_DIR/manifest.yaml"
```

The `pip install --target dist/<os>-<arch>/python .` step installs the
tool's own package (declared in `pyproject.toml`), plus every transitive
dep including `sam-tool-sdk`, into `python/`. The `[project.scripts]`
entry is dropped as a console script at `python/bin/<name>` — the path
the STR manifest's `executable:` field points at.

Two implications worth being explicit about:

- **To customise the build**, edit `build.sh` (and the matching
  `build.bat`) in place. The script's contract — populate
  `$SAM_TOOL_BUILD_OUT` with everything the runtime needs and copy
  `manifest.yaml` alongside — is the only thing the pipeline enforces.
- **To opt into the pure convention path**, delete `build.sh` and
  `build.bat`. With only `go.mod` (or `requirements.txt` /
  `pyproject.toml`) present, the resolver falls to the convention
  strategy and invokes the language toolchain directly via `os/exec`.
  Convention builds are slightly faster (no shell, no script parse) and
  cross-platform without a separate `.bat`, but you lose the
  customisation hook.

### Why `_sdk/` (not `vendor/`)?

Go treats a top-level `vendor/` directory
as a complete dependency snapshot and refuses to build unless every
transitive dependency is present there. Naming the directory `_sdk/`
sidesteps that, and the leading underscore additionally hides it from
`go build ./...` of any surrounding module.

### `sam toolset sync`

```
sam toolset sync [PATH] [--name NAME] [--lang go|python]
```

Re-vendors the embedded SDK into existing tools. PATH accepts the same
three forms as `init`; without `--name` a repo-wide invocation refreshes
every tool under `toolsets/*/src/`. `--name` restricts to a single tool;
`--lang` overrides the per-tool language detection (defaults to
inferring from `go.mod` or `pyproject.toml`).

Examples:

```
sam toolset sync                              # CWD → every toolsets/*/src/
sam toolset sync ./my-repo                    # repo root → every toolsets/*/src/
sam toolset sync ./my-repo/toolsets/pptx      # single toolset
sam toolset sync --name pptx                  # name-scoped refresh in a multi-toolset repo
```

`sync` always overwrites whatever is present — no diff check. Pair it
with a CLI upgrade to refresh stale vendored SDK copies in one shot.

## Resolution order

The resolver inspects the toolset source dir in this order. The first
match wins:

1. **Host-appropriate build script.**
   - On Mac/Linux: `build.sh`.
   - On Windows: `build.bat`.
   - If the **other** OS's script is the only one present (e.g. only
     `build.sh` on Windows), the resolver hard-errors with
     `toolset "foo" has build.sh but no build.bat — not buildable on windows`.
2. **Go convention.** A `go.mod` at the source dir root selects this
   strategy. The build runs `go build -o dist/<name>[.exe] <entry>`,
   where `<entry>` is `.` (a root-level `package main`) or
   `./cmd/<name>` when a single subdirectory under `cmd/` exists.
   Multiple `cmd/` subdirectories is a hard error — provide
   `build.sh` + `build.bat` to disambiguate.
3. **Python convention.** `requirements.txt` (preferred) or
   `pyproject.toml` selects this strategy. The build runs
   `pip install --target dist/<os>-<arch>/python --platform <target>
   --python-version <ver> --only-binary=:all: .` so the tool's own
   package, its declared deps, and `sam-tool-sdk` all land in
   `python/` as an AWS-Lambda-Layer-style bundle the STR can load
   directly. The `[project.scripts]` console-script entry is dropped at
   `dist/<os>-<arch>/python/bin/<name>`.
4. **Pre-built artifact.** A non-source executable named `<name>` /
   `<name>.exe` at the source dir root with no Go/Python/script source
   alongside is bundled as-is.
5. **Fallback.** Anything else is bundled as-is — the legacy WI-7
   behavior. Useful for raw-asset toolsets that need no compilation.

## Build script contract

When a script-based plan runs, the resolver invokes it directly via
`os/exec` (no shell interpretation). The script receives:

- **Working directory:** the toolset source dir
  (`toolsets/<name>/src/`).
- **Env vars:**
  - `SAM_TOOL_NAME` — the toolset name (= the directory name under
    `toolsets/`).
  - `SAM_TOOL_BUILD_OUT` — absolute path to the per-target dist
    subdir (`toolsets/<name>/dist/<targetOS>-<targetArch>/`). The
    bundler zips this directory verbatim, so populate it with
    everything the runtime needs (binaries, vendored deps, config
    files, …). Always write to `$SAM_TOOL_BUILD_OUT` rather than a
    bare `dist/` — two builds for different targets in the same
    workspace must land in distinct subdirs or the second one
    overwrites the first.
  - `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_OS` / `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_ARCH` — the deployment
    target (`linux/arm64` by default for the RC STR). Honour these in
    every cross-compile (`GOOS="$SAM_TOOL_TARGET_OS"
    GOARCH="$SAM_TOOL_TARGET_ARCH" go build …`); the build pipeline
    runs `file`/magic verification on the produced binary and refuses
    to cache a Mach-O when the requested target is `linux`.
  - `SAM_TOOL_SDK_VERSION` — the samtoolsdk version when known.
- **Exec bit:** the script must be executable on Mac/Linux (`chmod +x`).
  The resolver does not chmod on your behalf.
- **Exit code:** non-zero exits surface the last 50 lines of combined
  stdout/stderr in the error message.

Authoring `build.sh` / `build.bat` is the same trust boundary as
authoring tool code itself: both run with the privileges of the
authoring repo, and the produced `dist/` payload runs in the STR
sandbox at execution time.

## `dist/` output convention

Every strategy lands its outputs in
`<source-dir>/dist/<targetOS>-<targetArch>/`. The bundler zips that
per-target subdir deterministically (sorted entries, fixed mtime,
executable bit preserved on individual files) and uploads the zip —
never the raw source tree. Sibling target subdirs (e.g. a `darwin-arm64/`
left behind from a local laptop build) are ignored.

| Strategy | What lands in `dist/<os>-<arch>/` |
|---|---|
| `Script` | Whatever the script writes to `$SAM_TOOL_BUILD_OUT`. Authoring contract is yours — but honour `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_OS`/`ARCH` in every cross-compile. |
| `GoConvention` | The single compiled binary (`dist/<os>-<arch>/<name>` or `dist/<os>-<arch>/<name>.exe`). Source files are NOT copied. |
| `PythonConvention` | AWS-Lambda-Layer-style: `dist/<os>-<arch>/python/` contains the tool's own package, every transitive dep including `sam-tool-sdk`, and the `[project.scripts]` console-script entry at `python/bin/<name>`. The STR adds `dist/<os>-<arch>/python/` to `PYTHONPATH` at runtime and invokes the console-script binary directly. |

The bundler always wipes and re-creates the active per-target subdir
before running a build, so stale outputs from a prior strategy can't
sneak into the zip. Other target subdirs survive — switching between
`linux/arm64` and `darwin/arm64` builds in the same workspace is a fast
toggle, not a full rebuild.

## Cache

Built bundles are stored per-toolset AND per-target at
`toolsets/<name>/.sam-cache/build/<targetOS>-<targetArch>/<hash>.zip`,
where `<hash>` is computed from:

- The plan kind discriminator.
- The target tuple (`linux/arm64`, `darwin/arm64`, …) — so a hash
  computed for one target can never collide with another.
- Sorted bytes of every file under the source dir except outputs
  (`dist/`, `.sam-cache/`, `vendor/`, `.deps/`, `python/`, `_sdk/`)
  and the standard bundler exclusions (`.git`, `node_modules`,
  `__pycache__`, …).
- The build script bytes (`build.sh` + `build.bat` when present).
- The samtoolsdk version pinned in `go.mod` / `requirements.txt`.

Cache hits short-circuit the build step entirely. The plan output marks
them with `[BUILD: cache-hit <os>/<arch>]`. Cache misses run the build,
mark the op `[BUILD: built <os>/<arch> (Δs)]`, and write the resulting
zip back. Per-toolset isolation means deleting a toolset directory
removes its cache automatically; per-target segmentation means a local
`darwin/arm64` build can never be served against a `linux/arm64` apply
(the bug this layout was introduced to fix).

On the first cache write, the following patterns are auto-added to
`<repo-root>/.gitignore` so build outputs don't leak into git:

```
toolsets/*/.sam-cache/
toolsets/*/dist/
toolsets/*/src/vendor/
```

### Pruning

The cache never auto-prunes — predictability over magic. Run on demand:

```
sam config cache prune              # entries older than 30 days
sam config cache prune --max-age 168h
sam config cache prune --max-size 1073741824   # 1 GiB cap
sam config cache prune --all                   # wipe everything
```

`--all` is mutually exclusive with `--max-age` / `--max-size`.

## `--no-build` flag

For CI flows that build in a separate step, both plan and apply accept
`--no-build`:

| Subcommand | `--no-build` behavior |
|---|---|
| `sam config plan --no-build` | Skip builds. Cache hits resolve normally. Misses surface as `[BUILD: skipped — will run at apply]`. No error. |
| `sam config apply --no-build` | Strict: cache hits resolve normally; misses are a hard error. |

Typical CI pattern:

```sh
sam config plan         # cold: builds + populates each toolset's cache
# ... CI uploads toolsets/*/.sam-cache/build/ as a build artifact ...
sam config apply --no-build   # warm: cache hits resolve, no toolchains needed
```

`sam config plan --no-build` followed by `sam config apply` (without
`--no-build`) builds on apply — the apply path doesn't carry plan-time
decisions, so it re-resolves every toolset from scratch.

## Authoring pitfalls

These bite first-time authors. Reading order matters: the rules are
listed roughly in the order they manifest as visible failures.

### Optional vs required parameters

A parameter field is **optional** when it is either a pointer type OR
its `json:` tag carries `,omitempty`. Either signal alone is enough.

```go
// Pointer form. Branch on nil in the handler.
type FindUsersParams struct {
    Department *string `json:"department,omitempty"`
    Limit      *int    `json:"limit,omitempty"`
}

// Value-with-omitempty form. Branch on zero value in the handler;
// callers that wanted to send the zero value explicitly can't.
type FindUsersParams struct {
    Department string `json:"department,omitempty"`
    Limit      int    `json:"limit,omitempty"`
}
```

Both forms put the same fields in `properties` and leave them out of
`required` — the resulting JSON schema is identical. They differ in
two ways the SDK does care about:

1. **In your handler**, the pointer form lets you distinguish "caller
   omitted the field" (`nil`) from "caller explicitly sent the zero
   value" (`*p == ""` / `*p == 0`). The value form collapses both
   into the zero value. Prefer the pointer form when that distinction
   matters (e.g. `Limit=0` should mean "let the tool default" rather
   than "return 0 results").

2. **At `--schema` discovery time**, the value-with-omitempty form
   triggers an authoring warning (see below). The pointer form is
   silent.

A non-pointer field without `,omitempty` is **required**.

If you forget BOTH signals on a field that should be optional, the
STR rejects calls that omit it with `"Invoking <toolname>() failed as
the following mandatory input parameters are not present:
<field-list>"`. The quickest diagnostic is
`sam api /api/v1/platform/toolsets/<id> --jq '[.tools[] |
{name:.toolName, required:.parameters.required}]'` — anything that
shouldn't be required tells you which field needs a pointer or an
omitempty.

The SDK also emits a stderr warning at `--schema` discovery time when
the two signals disagree — a non-pointer field with `,omitempty` is
honoured as optional, but the warning surfaces the mismatch so you
can switch to a pointer if you wanted the stronger "this can be
nil-distinguished-from-zero" guarantee:

```
samtoolsdk: FindUsersParams.Department has json `,omitempty` but is
non-pointer (string); treating as optional. Use a pointer type (e.g.
*string) and drop `,omitempty` to silence this warning, or remove
`,omitempty` if the field should be required.
```

### Tool `Description` vs `WithInstructions`

`sdk.NewTool(name, description, …)` — the **description** (short
one-liner, second arg) is what the platform stores as the tool's
public DTO field and what the agent prompt's tool-selection table
shows. Keep it tight and accurate; it's the LLM's primary signal for
"which tool do I want."

`sdk.WithInstructions(text)` — the **instructions** are longer prose
guidance the agent surfaces alongside the tool. Useful for nuanced
"when to use this" notes, but historically the agent's prompt builder
has been observed to scramble these across tools in the rendered
prompt, so don't depend on instructions for correctness — make the
description + JSON schema self-sufficient.

### Returning data: `WithData` vs `WithDataObjects`

Tool handlers return `*sdk.Result` via one of the constructors
(`sdk.OK`, `sdk.Error`, `sdk.Partial`) plus optional `ResultOption`
modifiers. There are **two** ways to attach payload data, and the
choice matters for LLM context budget:

- **`sdk.WithData(map[string]any{...})`** — inline. Every key is
  spread at the top level of the JSON the agent feeds back to the
  LLM. Use this for **small, scalar summaries**: counts, flags, a
  single record, a rendered markdown snippet the LLM should reason
  over directly. Whatever you put here is paid for in tokens on
  every subsequent turn of the conversation.

- **`sdk.WithDataObjects(sdk.DataObject{...})`** — content items
  the agent may store as **versioned artifacts** instead of inlining.
  Use this for **bulky or binary payloads**: JSON trees, list/search
  results that can grow, images, generated documents. The LLM gets a
  small reference (`artifacts_created: [{filename, version, size_bytes,
  mime_type, description}]`) and can drill in later with the built-in
  artifact tools (`extract_jsonpath_from_artifact`,
  `search_replace_artifact`, …) without re-fetching.

A `DataObject.Disposition` controls how the agent routes each one:

| Disposition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `DispositionAuto` *(default if unset)* | Save as artifact when content is binary OR larger than `ToolOutputSaveThresholdBytes` (default 4 KB); otherwise inline (truncated at `ToolOutputLLMReturnMaxBytes`, default 8 KB). |
| `DispositionArtifact` | Always save as artifact. Use for content the LLM never benefits from seeing inline (images, large blobs, anything the user-facing UI will render from storage). |
| `DispositionInline` | Always return content directly to the LLM as a string under `inline_outputs[].content`. Use sparingly — the artifact path is almost always better. |
| `DispositionArtifactWithPreview` | Save as artifact AND emit a short `preview` string the LLM sees alongside the reference. |

The SDK auto-detects binary content (non-UTF-8 bytes) and base64-encodes
on the wire — you pass raw `Content []byte`, the framework handles
encoding and `IsBinary` signalling for you. Don't base64-encode in your
handler.

**Hybrid pattern (recommended for any list/tree/large-record tool):**
attach small summary fields via `WithData` and the bulky payload via
`WithDataObjects(DispositionAuto)`. Counts and flags stay cheap to
glance at; the heavy payload only crosses the LLM context boundary
when it's actually small enough to be worth inlining.

```go
func getOrgChart(ctx context.Context, p Params, tc *sdk.ToolContext) (*sdk.Result, error) {
    tree, markdown, err := provider.getOrgChart(ctx, p.UserID)
    if err != nil {
        return sdk.Error("org chart failed: " + err.Error()), nil
    }
    if tree == nil {
        return sdk.OK("No directory record."), nil
    }
    treeJSON, err := json.Marshal(tree)
    if err != nil {
        return sdk.Error("encode tree: " + err.Error()), nil
    }
    return sdk.OK("Org chart retrieved.",
        // markdown is the rendered summary the LLM should reason over —
        // keep it inline so it shows up directly in the tool result.
        sdk.WithData(map[string]any{"markdown": markdown}),
        // The full JSON tree can be 50+ records deep; let the framework
        // promote it to an artifact when it crosses 4 KB.
        sdk.WithDataObjects(sdk.DataObject{
            Name:        "org_chart.json",
            Content:     treeJSON,
            MIMEType:    "application/json",
            Disposition: sdk.DispositionAuto,
            Description: "Org chart tree for " + p.UserID,
        }),
    ), nil
}
```

**Pure-artifact case** — for content that should never round-trip
through the LLM context (images, generated PDFs, large CSVs), use
`DispositionArtifact` so the size check is bypassed:

```go
return sdk.OK("Profile picture retrieved.",
    sdk.WithData(map[string]any{"mime_type": contentType}),
    sdk.WithDataObjects(sdk.DataObject{
        Name:        "profile_picture.jpg",
        Content:     rawImageBytes,   // raw bytes; SDK base64-encodes on wire
        MIMEType:    contentType,
        Disposition: sdk.DispositionArtifact,
        Description: "Profile picture for " + userID,
    }),
), nil
```

**Anti-pattern: serializing structured data into a string under
`WithData`.** If you find yourself doing
`sdk.WithData(map[string]any{"results": jsonString})` to make a
"compact" inline payload, that's the wrong shape — switch to
`WithDataObjects(...)` and let the framework decide.

### `WithDataObjects` is mandatory for data-driven payloads

Any tool whose response could plausibly be JSON, CSV, YAML, XML, or
any other structured/textual blob — and where the **size is driven
by data, not by a fixed shape** — MUST attach the body via
`WithDataObjects(... DispositionAuto)`, not `WithData`. This rule
covers:

- HTTP / REST wrappers (Salesforce, Jira, Datadog, custom services).
- SOQL / SQL / GraphQL query tools.
- File processors and converters that emit text.
- Tools that return list / search / describe / schema payloads.
- Anything where one call can return 50 records and the next returns
  50 000.

`WithData` for the body is a footgun: a single oversized response
balloons every subsequent turn's prompt and silently degrades the
agent. `DispositionAuto` keeps small responses inline (≤4 KB by
default, after which the framework promotes to an artifact) so you
get the right behavior on both ends of the size spectrum for free.

A small **summary** under `WithData` (status code, row count,
truncation flag, "next page" token) is fine — those are tiny scalars
the LLM should be able to branch on without a tool call. The bulk
payload belongs in the artifact.

### Let the LLM name its artifacts

Tools that produce artifacts MUST expose `output_filename` (or
`output_filename_prefix` for multi-file tools) and `description` as
optional parameters. A tool that hard-codes a single filename —
`query_result.json` for every SOQL call, `response.json` for every
REST call — gives the LLM no way to tell results apart in a
multi-call turn: every write lands on the same name, only the
version number changes, and `«artifact_content:query_result.json»`
silently resolves to "whichever was last". The fix is one tiny
schema addition:

```go
type Params struct {
    // ... operation-specific fields ...

    OutputFilename *string `json:"output_filename,omitempty" desc:"Filename for the response artifact, including extension (.json/.csv/.md/...). Pick something specific to this call (e.g. 'open_p1_cases.json', 'case_12345_with_comments.json') so you can reference it later via «artifact_content:...». Default: derived from the request shape."`
    Description    *string `json:"description,omitempty" desc:"Short human-readable description of what's in this artifact. Surfaced in the user's artifact list and in the artifact's metadata."`
}
```

Wire it through in the handler:

```go
name := defaultArtifactName(...)
if p.OutputFilename != nil && *p.OutputFilename != "" {
    name = *p.OutputFilename
}
description := fmt.Sprintf("...sensible default...")
if p.Description != nil && *p.Description != "" {
    description = *p.Description
}
return sdk.OK("...",
    sdk.WithDataObjects(sdk.DataObject{
        Name:        name,
        Content:     body,
        MIMEType:    "application/json",
        Disposition: sdk.DispositionAuto,
        Description: description,
    }),
), nil
```

Light validation belongs in the handler: reject `..` and `/`, cap
length at ~80 characters, ensure the extension matches the actual
content type. The artifact store versions same-named writes, so a
reused name is safe — but the *point* of letting the LLM choose is
that it stops doing that on its own.

For tools that produce **multiple artifacts per call** (e.g. a
multi-object query that fans out into one artifact per record type,
an archive extractor, a multi-file generator), expose
`output_filename_prefix` instead:

```go
OutputFilenamePrefix *string `json:"output_filename_prefix,omitempty" desc:"Prefix for the artifact filenames this call produces. The tool appends a stable per-output suffix (e.g. '<prefix>_cases.json', '<prefix>_contacts.json'). Default: derived from the call."`
```

The handler is responsible for the suffix scheme — pick one that's
stable across runs and self-explanatory in a listing.

### Poisoned build cache

`sam config plan/apply` keys the build cache by a hash of (plan kind,
target tuple, source files, build script bytes, SDK version). A cache
hit short-circuits the build entirely (`[BUILD: cache-hit <os>/<arch>]`).
If a build was once produced with a stale SDK (or with a `build.sh`
that ignored `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_*` on an older sam-go) that bad zip
stays in the cache and the cache-hit keeps re-uploading it.

Cross-target poisoning specifically is prevented by segmenting both
the cache path (`.sam-cache/build/<os>-<arch>/<hash>.zip`) and the
`dist/` output (`dist/<os>-<arch>/<binary>`) by the target. A
darwin/arm64 build can no longer overwrite a linux/arm64 entry — they
live in different subdirectories. The `[BUILD: cache-hit darwin/arm64]`
line surfaces the target so an operator notices when the wrong
platform's binary is being reused.

Symptoms: platform `discoveryStatus: failed` with `exec format error`
after a `[BUILD: cache-hit]` run (only possible now if the toolset was
ever built on an old sam-go without the segmented layout); or new
tools you registered in `main.go` are missing from `--schema` output
of the cached binary.

Cure: bust the cache for that toolset, then re-apply.

```bash
rm -rf toolsets/<name>/.sam-cache/build/
sam config apply --manifest manifests/dev.yaml
```

### Re-uploading a toolset that's already in use

The platform refuses to re-upload (HTTP 409 `PackageInUse`) a toolset
that is referenced by any currently-deployed agent — the upload would
race the running agents' tool dispatch. The error names the holding
agent IDs.

For development iteration, use `sam config apply --force-toolset` to
append `?force=true` to the upload calls. The platform overwrites the
package and auto-redeploys every affected agent via the outbox
publisher (the redeploy is async; the first attempt may transiently
fail with `tool package not ready` while discovery is pending,
followed by a retry that succeeds — both are normal and the apply
returns success once the upload itself lands).

Without `--force-toolset` the safe sequence is: undeploy each
referenced agent, apply, then redeploy.

### STR per-invocation lifetime — no cross-call cache

Every STR tool dispatch spawns a fresh worker process. Any
`sync.Map`, in-memory struct cache, or "lazy init once" you wire into
your tool's `main()` lives for **exactly one tool call**. If your
tool pays a meaningful warm-up cost (large directory pull, expensive
connection setup, big in-memory index), every call pays it from
cold.

There is currently no SDK-provided cross-invocation cache. Workarounds
authors have used: persist the snapshot to a temp file under
`/tmp/sam-str/<toolset>/...` with a timestamp, then on next start
reuse the snapshot when it's young enough; or design the API so the
first tool call fetches and subsequent calls in the same conversation
take filter/page parameters instead. Be aware of the limitation when
choosing how to shape your tools.

### Skill bundles vs STR toolsets

A `kind: skill` can attach **built-in** tools via its SKILL.md
`tools:` frontmatter — that's a closed list of tools registered in
the agent binary. It cannot directly attach an STR toolset's tools.

To use an STR toolset, list it in the **agent's** `toolsets:` block.
The skill body can name the resulting tools (`<toolset>__<tool>`,
double-underscore separator — see [skill design](../design/skill-design.md))
as prompt guidance, but the toolset itself is wired on the agent.

## Cross-platform notes

- Mac/Linux toolsets that don't need Windows can ship just `build.sh`.
- Windows-supporting toolsets must ship **both** `build.sh` and
  `build.bat` (one per host).
- Convention-based builds (Go and Python) work on every host without
  shell scripts because the resolver invokes the language toolchain
  directly via `os/exec`.

## Cross-compile target (Go toolsets)

The deployed STR is almost always a different architecture from the
author's dev machine. `sam config apply` handles this automatically for
Go-convention toolsets by querying
`GET /api/v1/platform/toolsets/buildTarget` and cross-compiling for the
returned `(GOOS, GOARCH)`. Resolution order:

1. `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_OS` / `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_ARCH` env vars (explicit pin wins).
2. Platform endpoint (the STR's actual runtime).
3. `linux/arm64` fallback if the platform is unreachable.

A mixed-fleet response (multiple distinct STR architectures online) is a
hard apply error citing the observed targets — pin one explicitly via
the env vars and rerun. The resolved `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_OS` /
`SAM_TOOL_TARGET_ARCH` are also passed through to author-supplied
`build.sh` / `build.bat` so custom builds can honour them.

For builds outside `sam config apply` (hand-rolled `go build`, CI),
`sam toolset target -t <platform-url>` prints the resolved target
in `text` (`linux/arm64`), `--format json`, or `--format shell` form. The
shell form is `eval`-friendly:

```bash
eval "$(sam toolset target -t https://platform.example.com --format shell)"
go build -o tools/mytool/dist/mytool ./tools/mytool/source/...
```

**Arch mismatch is the most common reason tool discovery fails in
production** — symptom is a platform `discoveryStatus=failed` with
`"binary cannot run on this host: it's Mach-O 64-bit ... but STR is
running on linux/arm64"`. If `sam config apply` is doing the build, the
CLI picks the right arch automatically; otherwise, run
`sam toolset target` and feed the result to your build.

## Worked examples

### A tiny Go toolset

```
toolsets/customer-tools.yaml      # kind: toolset, name: customer-tools
toolsets/customer-tools/
  src/
    go.mod
    main.go                       # package main, samtoolsdk-driven
```

Plan output:

```
* CREATE  toolset/customer-tools  [BUILD: built linux/arm64 (1.2s)]    customer-tools.yaml
```

A second `sam config plan` with no source changes:

```
= UPDATE  toolset/customer-tools  [BUILD: cache-hit linux/arm64]  customer-tools.yaml
```

### A tiny Python toolset

```
toolsets/web-tools.yaml
toolsets/web-tools/
  src/
    pyproject.toml                # sam-tool-sdk>=0.1,<0.2 + requests
                                  # [project.scripts] web-tools = "web_tools:cli"
    src/web_tools/
      __init__.py
      __main__.py                 # cli = tool_cli(fetch_url)
    build.sh                      # cross-arch pip install --target dist/.../python
    manifest.yaml                 # executable: python/bin/web-tools
```

Plan output (cold):

```
* CREATE  toolset/web-tools  [BUILD: built linux/arm64 (3.8s)]   web-tools.yaml
```

`toolsets/web-tools/dist/linux-arm64/` after build contains
`python/requests/...`, `python/sam_tool_sdk/...`, and `python/bin/<name>`
(the console-script entry declared in `pyproject.toml` under
`[project.scripts]`). The whole `python/` tree is on the STR's
PYTHONPATH at runtime.

### A custom build with `build.sh` + `build.bat`

```
toolsets/exotic-tool.yaml
toolsets/exotic-tool/
  src/
    build.sh                      # uses cargo, custom node toolchain, etc.
    build.bat                     # Windows equivalent
    ...                           # whatever the scripts know how to build
```

The script is responsible for populating `toolsets/exotic-tool/dist/`.
The resolver runs the host-appropriate script and zips whatever lands.

### A pulled (mirror-flow) toolset — no build

```
toolsets/billing-tools.yaml       # metadata from `sam config pull`
toolsets/billing-tools/
  billing-tools.zip               # bundle bytes from `sam config pull`
```

Plan output:

```
* CREATE  toolset/billing-tools   [BUILD: none]   billing-tools.yaml
```

The pre-built zip is uploaded verbatim — the build pipeline is skipped
entirely. This is the canonical state of a freshly-pulled toolset.
